# 30-Day Python Playground

## Overview
- Designed for second-grade beginners learning Python at home or in class.
- Focuses on curiosity, iteration, and hands-on practice through 30 bite-sized lessons.
- Each `dayN.py` module contains the complete lesson plan: objectives, teaching flow, sample code, in-class practice, and graded homework with reference solutions.

## Learning Goals
- Build confidence with Python syntax, print statements, variables, and arithmetic.
- Develop problem-solving habits with conditionals, loops, data structures, and functions.
- Encourage defensive programming, modular design, and code reviews just like real developers.
- Ship playful mini-projects culminating in a text-based adventure story.

## Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.9 or newer.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run any lesson with `python dayN.py` (replace `N` with the lesson number).
4. Encourage kids to edit the practice section before checking the provided solution.

## Daily Lesson Format
- **Knowledge Points**: Concepts and vocabulary for the lesson.
- **Lesson Flow**: Suggested pacing for introduction, exploration, and wrap-up.
- **Teaching Demos**: Runnable examples demonstrated live.
- **In-Class Practice**: Quick edits learners can try immediately.
- **Homework**: Reinforcement tasks with validated `homework_solution` functions.

## 30-Day Roadmap

- **Day 2**: 玩转数字和变量 – comments, naming rules, numeric ops.
- **Day 3**: 学会和计算机对话 – `input`, type conversion, friendly prompts.
- **Day 4**: 认识比较运算和布尔值 – comparisons and boolean logic.
- **Day 5**: 初识 `if` 判断 – basic branching with positive feedback loops.

### Days 6–10 · Controlling the Flow
- **Day 6**: 更多条件 – `elif`, logical operators, richer branching.
- **Day 7**: `while` 循环入门 – counters, termination, `break`.
- **Day 8**: `for` 循环与 `range` – iteration patterns and accumulators.
- **Day 9**: 字符串的奥秘 – length, slicing, safe indexing.
- **Day 10**: 字符串小工坊 – string methods, formatting, f-strings.

### Days 11–15 · Working with Collections
- **Day 11**: 列表初体验 – list basics, indexing, `append`.
- **Day 12**: 列表操作再升级 – `insert`, `pop`, `remove`, copies.
- **Day 13**: 循环遍历列表 – `enumerate`, aggregations, filtering.
- **Day 14**: 字符串与列表转换 – `split`, `join`, data cleanup.
- **Day 15**: 不可变伙伴 `tuple` – tuples and unpacking.

### Days 16–20 · Data + Functions + Modules
- **Day 16**: 字典开启信息库 – key/value storage and iteration.
- **Day 17**: 组合数据 – list-of-dicts rosters and page counts.
- **Day 18**: 自定义函数入门 – parameters, returns, reusable helpers.
- **Day 19**: 函数参数进阶 – defaults, keyword arguments, multi-return.
- **Day 20**: 善用模块 – `import`, `math`, `random`, dice games.

### Days 21–25 · Projects & Defensive Skills
- **Day 21**: 猜数字小游戏 – loops, feedback, attempt tracking.
- **Day 22**: 守护程序 – input validation with `try/except`.
- **Day 23**: 小算法 – `min`, `max`, sorting, preserving originals.
- **Day 24**: 集合 `set` 的神奇能力 – deduplication, unions, intersections.
- **Day 25**: 列表推导 – concise list generation and comparisons.

### Days 26–30 · Storytelling & Reflection
- **Day 26**: 故事生成小项目 – random storytelling, reusable functions.
- **Day 27**: 调试小帮手 – `print` diagnostics, `assert` safety rails.
- **Day 28**: 模块化设计 – decomposing tasks, `main` orchestration.
- **Day 29**: 文本冒险筹备 – scene graphs, branching choices, scoring.
- **Day 30**: 庆祝与提升 – tests, retrospectives, future roadmap.

## Extending the Course
- Invite learners to rewrite prompts in English or another language to build multilanguage skills.
- Use `assets/` for supporting visuals or printable worksheets.
- Encourage students to version-control their changes to see growth over time.
- Turn homework solutions into peer code reviews to practice giving and receiving feedback.

Happy coding, and enjoy the 30-day adventure! Each lesson is ready to run and remix—just open the corresponding `dayN.py` file and start exploring together.
